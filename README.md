# Usage
running `HFSR.ipynb` directly.


There are only a few images included in Folder `Set14`, the whole images
can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/huangzehao/Super-Resolution.Benckmark) to replace the original Folder.


# Introduction

Python version of single image super-resolution via sparse representation.

Different from traditional method using learning-based dictionary, we use the
function-based dictionary.

See more details in [HFSR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04363)
